# Deep-Q-Learning-on-Atari-Game-Breakout

Reproduction of a paper study by Google DeepMind, implemented the proposed DQN structure through python, used Keras with TensorFlow as backend.

In this project, we show the deep reinforcement learning has a good ability to learn how to play the game Breakout.
Without knowing the knowledge or rules of the game, the agent can develop an optimal strategy purely by the high-dimensional 
sensory data. We uses a convo- lutional neural network to approximate a reward function, Q-function to predict the longterm 
reward to guide the de- cision making process and demonstrate that it is able to achieve human-level performance.
